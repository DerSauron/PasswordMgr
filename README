Password Manager
================

The password manager is a QT5 based application that lets you create secure
passwords with configurable options. The options can be saved in reusable
presets.

For users with enabled KWallet-System (KDE5) the passwords can be
stored in the wallet.
The kwallet-support can be enabled at compile time
